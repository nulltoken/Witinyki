# Witinyki

Is an itsy, bitsy, teenie, weenie, [LibGit2Sharp](https://www.github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) based wiki.

## Quick start guide

 - Launch "init.packages.cmd" to automatically NuGet-install the dependencies of this project
 - If not already exisiting, a sample git-powered wiki repository will be created upon the start of the web application

## Quick contributing guide

 - Fork and clone locally
 - Configure your repo to convert line endings on commit so they are always LF in the repo:
 - Create a topic specific branch. Add some nice feature. Do not forget the tests ;-)
 - Send a Pull Request to spread the fun!
