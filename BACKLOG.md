# Witinyki Backlog

### Web

 - Add Create, Rename and Edit page actions (those actions should accept the current hash of the wiki HEAD as an additional parameter to avoid concurrency issues)
 - Add Markdown support

### Tests

 - Add tests exercising wrong routes
 
### Miscellaneous

 - Segregate as a "wiki" area?
 - Package as an HttpModule and register dynamically?
